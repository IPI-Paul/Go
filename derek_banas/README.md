## Course Work

 - Derek covered a lot of ground in a short space of time.
 - Learning the fundamentals in this course and all other courses by Derek have been key to improving my understanding and skill levels.
 - I was glad to find after Google searches that I could call functions by name in Go, as this makes it easier to call each example with less code. Hence, less distraction.
 - Again, I would have liked to learn how to create a stand alone binary.
