## Course Work

 - At first I followed along replacing code examples as done in the tutorial.
 - I then converted each example into packages of their own using the package main o call them.
 - The course was very informative and easy to follow. Also, I prefer learning how to develop apps whilst learning the fundamentals of any programming language.
 - I would have liked to see an example of how to turn the app into a standalone binary.
